Immediate goals:
1) Each agent is a separate class with a separate motion primitive file
2) Change getSuccs to reflect 1)
3) Clean up getcoord, egraph stuff
4) Upgrade to x,y,z,theta
5) Collision checking and footprint

Future goals:
1) Generate motion primitives
2) Decentralized architecture + communication
3) Generate goals from map
4) Obstacle detection? planning?


July 1 : Finish Immediate goals 1,2,3
July 2 : Immediate goal 4 + start cleanup


By July 6, 7: Get decentralized planner?

Next week: Start work on robot?
