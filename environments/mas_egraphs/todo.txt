Joint planner works, couple of mods needed:

Only allow agent to retire immediately after arriving at a goal. Currently, agents can go back to a goal anytime and retire.
Heuristic for active agent without assignment is now min distance to an unvisited goal.
maxnumgoals for bitset can be changed to be exactly numgoals.

Currently working on comm framework
