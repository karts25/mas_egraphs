Immediate goals:
1) Each agent is a separate class with a separate motion primitive file 
2) Change getSuccs to reflect 1)                          -- done
3) Clean up getcoord, egraph stuff
4) Upgrade to x,y,z,theta, use pr2 motion primitive files -- done
5) Collision checking and footprint                       -- done

-- collision checking a bit sketchy, eveything else done up to heuristic calibration/ new motion primitives

Future goals:
1) Generate motion primitives
2) Decentralized architecture + communication
3) Generate goals from map
4) Obstacle detection? planning?


July 1 : Finish Immediate goals 1,2,3
July 2 : Immediate goal 4 + start cleanup


By July 6, 7: Get decentralized planner?

Next week: Start work on robot?



Andrew:

architecture
x,y,theta planner with hexacopter on separate level? - state space is x,y,z,theta or just x,y,z?
generating motion primitives 
Solving TSPs


July 8 status:

Need to add aerial vehicle:
   - z in costmap and planner
   - multiple motion primitive files and footprints

Heuristic computation is way too slow. 
   eg: 2 robots, 10 goals - 
       2^10 = 1024 possible assignments
       Each assignment solves at least 2 TSPs, worst case 10! evaluations

GetSuccs can be faster:
  - precompute combinatorial actions

Adding goals to map

Plan:

July 8: Speed up getsuccs [for fun]
        Add aerial vehicle

July 9: Swap out with MST based assignment heuristic
        

July 10: Start working with andrew on simulator
